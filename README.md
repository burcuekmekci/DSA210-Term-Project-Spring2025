# DSA210-Term-Project-Spring2025
I am a student from SabancÄ± University, Burcu Ekmekci, and this is my DSA210 term project for Spring 2025. 

# Project Subject & Purpose
The goal of this project is to use data science methods to investigate the association between excessive working hours, happiness, and mental health concerns.  A data-driven approach will be used to better understand how working people's happiness and mental health connect with their working hours. As a soon-to-be graduate, I have started to reflect on the importance of work-life balance and happiness in professional life. This project was inspired by my curiosity about how demanding work schedules might impact personal well-being. Through data analysis, I aim to explore the potential negative effects of excessive working hours and gain insights into how a fast-paced work environment may affect people's overall happiness.

# Hypotheses
The following hypotheses will be tested in this project:
* Do long working hours correlate with lower happiness levels?
* Are people less happy in countries with longer working hours?
* Do long working hours increase mental health problems?
* Is there a positive correlation between overtime work and the prevalence of depression and other mental illnesses?

# Description of Dataset
This project will use publicly available datasets from Our World in Data, including:
* Annual Working Hours per Person Employed (1970-2017)
  * Average annual working hours for full-time and part-time workers.
* Happiness & Life Satisfaction (1993-2022)
  * Survey responses to the question: "Are you satisfied with your life?"
  * The percentage of people who describe themselves as "very happy" or "fairly happy."
* Burden of Disease from Mental Illness (1990-2021)
  * Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 100,000 people due to mental illnesses, including depressive disorders, schizophrenia, and other conditions.

These datasets were downloaded in CSV format and will be processed for analysis.
